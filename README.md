# GoldBadgeProject
Project #1 is the KomodoCafe Console App
Project #2 is the KomodoInsurance Console App
Project #3 is the KomodoBadges Console App
This project is a collection of three Console Applications written in C#. 
It follows the basic repository pattern, 1 Class Library, 1 Program UI, 1 Program, and 1 Method Repo.

Challenge #1 uses a List, Challenge #2 uses a Queue and Challenge #3 use a Dictionary. 

The Unit Tests were straightforward. For the Badges Unit Test, I had to create a HelperMethod to use in an actual TestMethod.

I learned a lot working on this project, I can pretty much recite the entire Microsoft Dictionary Docs page by heart now... I spent a lot of time on that site...

I hope you enjoy using my simple, yet difficult Console Apps!
